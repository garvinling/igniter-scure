			<h3>Phase 1: Parts and Web Programming</h3> 
			<code>9/10/13</code>
			<p style="width:750px; font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif; color:gray; font-size:16px; line-height:21px;">
			The parts finally arrived this past weekend and we are extremely excited to start putting everything together.  We are working 
			long nights to develop our web application, as well as put together the hardware prototype.  There's something about new parts arriving
			in the mail that radiates excitement. Most likely...because.....we're temporarily free from the waves of debugging and faulty parts that
			that are sure to ensue.   But for now, we're extremely excited to be working on our first non-university hardware/software project!  Stay tuned!

			<h3>Inception and Prototyping</h3> 
			<code>8/28/13</code>
			<p style="width:750px; font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif; color:gray; font-size:16px; line-height:21px;">
			Prototyping stage is underway! Once the ordered parts come in, we will start setting up the basic communication protocols between our 
			main microcontroller unit and our web server.  First task we want to accomplish is setting up a secure/authentication protocol to sync up 
			the main hub device to the web server.
