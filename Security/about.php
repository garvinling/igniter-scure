			<p style="width:650px; color:gray; font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif; font-size:18px; line-height:29px;">
			Scure is an affordable plug-and-play security system to help you keep an eye on things.  There is no installation 
			or activation fee. Our system is designed to work right out of the box.  The Scure system syncs to your smartphone and can also
			be controlled on any computer through a web application with your custom Scure account.

			<h1 style="margin-top:30px;">Our Motivation</h1><br>
			<p style="width:650px; color:gray; font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif; font-size:18px; line-height:29px;">
			We want to design Scure to be a lightweight, compact, and affordable security system for your apartment or small business.  
			After taking a hard look at the different big-box home security systems, we saw that many of the packages that these companies offer are buried in installation fees and costly monthly dues.  
			We want to build Scure to be offered as a simple package that works out of the box.  
			
			<br><br>
			
			We firmly believe that every house, apartment, condo should implement some sort of security system.  Our goal is to eventually make home security systems ubiquitous.
			Cost is a huge deciding factor when installing a security system.  When you combine installation charges, actual hardware bundle price, and monthly dues, a security system
			a security system is no longer considered an affordable.  <br><br>
			
			Portability is a major issue for folks with less-permanent living situations, such as renters.  Many apartment buildings do not have any form 
			of security/alarm system and most apartment buildings will not allow renters to install a permanent security solutions.
			This forces renters to be at the mercy of their insurance policy.<br><br>
			
			Simplicity.  We find that the majority of security systems are offered in complicated bundles and packages.  Our aim is to provide a simple and 
			functional buying experience as well an easy-to-use interface for our users to access their system.
